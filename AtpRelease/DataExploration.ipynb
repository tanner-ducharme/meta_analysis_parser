      "We have shown previously that wounding of human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells resulted in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation through ectodomain shedding of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). However, the initial signal to trigger these signaling events in response to cell injury remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of ATP released from the injured cells in EGFR transactivation in HCE cells as well as in BEAS 2B cells, a bronchial epithelial cell line. Wounding of epithelial monolayer resulted in the release of ATP into the culture medium. The wound-induced rapid activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in HCE cells was attenuated by eliminating extracellular ATP, ADP and adenosine. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATP-gamma-S induced rapid and sustained EGFR activation that depended on HB-EGF shedding and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase). Targeting pathways leading to HB-EGF shedding and EGFR activation attenuated ATP-gamma-S-enhanced closure of small scratch wounds. The purinoceptor antagonist reactive blue 2 decreased wound closure and attenuated ATP-gamma-S induced HB-EGF shedding. Taken together, our data suggest that ATP, released upon epithelial injury, acts as an early signal to trigger cell responses including an increase in HB-EGF shedding, subsequent EGFR transactivation and its downstream signaling, resulting in wound healing.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Rotational atherectomy with the Rotablator catheter has improved percutaneous treatment of certain coronary atherosclerotic lesions, but the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon remains a serious complication. Because platelet activation by rotablation may contribute to the no-reflow phenomenon, we developed an in vitro system to test the effect of rotablation on platelets in the absence or presence of platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockade with abciximab.\r",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from 28 healthy human volunteers. PRP was divided into 4 samples: (1) no treatment, (2) 6D1 (anti-GP Ib), (3) c7E3 Fab (anti-GP IIb/IIIa+alpha(v)beta3), and (4) c7E3 Fab+6D1. Samples were pumped through a flow chamber containing a 2.5-mm burr rotating at various speeds and then placed in an aggregometer. PRP samples tested in the absence of antibody underwent more rapid and extensive aggregation when rotablated at 150000 and 180000 rpm compared with 0 rpm (P<0.001 at both speeds). Preincubation of platelets with c7E3 Fab decreased the slope of aggregation at each rotablation speed, with 98%, 79%, and 71% reductions at 70000, 150000, and 180000 rpm, respectively (P=0.09 for 70000 and P<0.001 for both 150000 and 180000 rpm). Preincubation of platelets with 6D1 did not decrease the slope of aggregation at any rotablation speed (P>0.5, P=0.99, and P=0.091 for 70000, 150000, and 180000 rpm). Platelet ATP release, a marker of granule release and cell damage, was markedly increased at 180000 rpm (P=0.002 compared with 0 rpm in the control group). Electron microscopy revealed extensive rotablation-induced platelet damage at 150000 and 180000 rpm, and leakage of LDH confirmed platelet lysis at these speeds (P=0.002 and P<0.001 compared with 0 rpm).\r",
      "CONCLUSIONS: High-speed rotablation induces platelet activation of PRP, leading to aggregation; pretreating PRP with abciximab decreases the aggregation. These data suggest that pretreatment of patients with abciximab may decrease rotablation-induced platelet aggregation during rotational atherectomy.\n",

      "Prior studies have demonstrated P2X receptor expression in the majority of nodose neurons. Immunoreactivity for P2X receptors has also been seen in putative gastric mechanoreceptors, the intraganglionic laminar endings. We therefore hypothesized that deletion of P2X3 receptors will blunt responses to gastric distension in vagal sensory neurons. Using wildtype and P2X3 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, we examined responses to purinergic agonists in retrogradely labelled gastric sensory neurons with patch-clamp techniques. Activation of gastro-oesophageal neurons by fluid distension was studied with intracellular electrodes. Distension-evoked ATP release into the gastric lumen was determined with the luciferase assay and intake and gastric emptying of a solid meal was assessed. ATP triggered inward currents in 80% of gastric nodose neurons. In P2X3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the peak current density was lower compared to controls. Ten of 14 controls but none of 30 neurons from P2X3<sup>-/-</sup> mice responded to alpha,beta-metATP. Gastro-oesophageal sensory neurons of P2X3<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a blunted response to fluid distension of oesophagus and stomach. This difference was not explained by differences in distension-evoked ATP release, which did not differ between knockout mice and controls. Food intake during a 3-h period was lower in P2X3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Gastric emptying of a solid meal was slightly faster in knockout mice after 1.5 h, but did not differ between groups at 3 h. Our data support a role of purinergic signalling in gastric vagal afferents. Considering the role of vagal input in sensations of fullness or nausea, P2X receptors may be interesting treatment targets for dyspeptic symptoms. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\n",

      "1. HL60 promyeloid cells contain high intracellular concentrations of inositol polyphosphates, notably inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). To determine their intracellular location(s), we studied the release of inositol (poly)phosphates, of ATP, and of cytosolic and granule-enclosed enzymes from cells permeabilized by four different methods. 2. When cells were treated with digitonin, all of the inositol phosphates were released in parallel with the cytosolic constituents. Most of the InsP5 and InsP6 was released before significant permeabilization of azurophil granules. 3. Similar results were obtained from cells preloaded with ethylene glycol and permeabilized by osmotic lysis. 4. Electroporation at approximately 500 V/cm caused rapid release of free inositol. Higher field strengths provoked release of most of the ATP, InsP5 and InsP6, but only slight release of the intracellular enzymes. Multiple discharges released approximately 80-90% of total InsP5 and InsP6. In the absence of bivalent-cation chelators, InsP5 and InsP6 were released less readily than ATP. 5. Treatment of cells with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin caused quantitative release of inositol and ATP, without release of intracellular enzymes. However, inositol phosphates were released much less readily than inositol or ATP. Even after prolonged incubation with a high concentration of alpha-toxin, only approximately 50-70% of InsP2, InsP3 and InsP4 and < or = 20% of InsP5 and InsP6 were released, indicating that the high charge or large hydrated radius of InsP5 and InsP6 might limit their release through small toxin-induced pores. 6. These results indicate that most intracellular inositol metabolites are either in, or in rapid exchange with, the cytosolic compartment of HL60 cells. However, they leave open the possibility that a small proportion of cellular InsP5 and InsP6 (< or = 10-20%) might be in some intracellular bound form.\n",

      "Objective: To investigate local vascular control in the isolated perfused premenopausal human ovary by measuring flow-induced release of vasoactive substances. Design: Release of adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP), substance P (SP), endothelin (ET), and vasopressin (AVP) from the ovarian vascular endothelium was estimated in perfusate under basal conditions and during two periods of increased flow. Main outcome measures: Vascular resistance; ATP, SP, ET and AVP release. Results: The mean ratio (pressure/flow during increased flow):(pressure/flow at basal flow) was 1.27 +/- 0.04 for the first, and 1.15 +/- 0.05 for the second period of increased flow (n = 10), indicating significant vasoconstriction (P < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively), present to a greater extent during the first period of increased flow compared to the second (P < 0.05). ATP release was seen in response to increased flow (n = 8, P < 0.05). From 12 ovarian bed preparations, five released ET and SP and three of these released AVP. Four of the five perfused ovaries that released peptides contained either a developing follicle or a corpus luteum while all those that showed no peptide release were inactive. Conclusions: ATP release may play a role in the local control of the human premenopausal ovarian vasculature independent of ovulatory status. Peptides may also contribute to local vascular control in the ovary and their release from predominantly active ovaries suggests a relationship between ovulation and vascular endothelial function.\n",

      "Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is commonly used in the treatment of fractures and nonunion-promoting acceleration of healing fractures. In this report, we investigated the implication of the P2 receptors in osteoblast proliferation induced with LIPUS treatment. We observed that ADP, ATP, UTP, and UDP promote osteoblast increase and an increase of intracellular Ca(2+), through activation of P2Y receptors. Osteoblasts' expression of the P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(6), P2Y(11), P2Y(12), and P2Y(13) receptors was confirmed. In addition, the participation of the P2Y(1) receptor in osteoblast increase and the ADP-dependent increase of Ca(2+) concentration were shown. Furthermore, release of ATP/purines was induced by LIPUS treatment. Finally, LIPUS-dependent osteoblast increase was abolished in the presence of the Ca(2+) chelator (BAPTA), the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist (2-APB), and the selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonist (MRS2179). In conclusion, LIPUS treatment induces osteoblastogenesis via the release of purines, such as ATP, activating P2Y receptors, mainly the P2Y(1) receptor.Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

      "A novel microflow technique is used to demonstrate that a weakened oxidant defense system found in diabetic erythrocytes leads to decreased levels of deformation-induced release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from erythrocytes. Addition of an oxidant to rabbit erythrocytes resulted in a 63% decrease in deformation-induced ATP release before eventually recovering to a value that was statistically equivalent to the initial value. Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase prevents recovery from the oxidant attack. Finally, results indicated that the ATP release from the erythrocytes of type II diabetics (91 nM +/- 10 nM) was less than half of that measured from the erythrocytes of healthy controls (190 +/- 10 nM). These data suggest that the antioxidant status of erythrocytes is a critical determinant in the ability of these cells to release ATP, a known nitric oxide stimulus.\n",

      "Extracellular ATP and other nucleotides are important autocrine/paracrine mediators that regulate diverse processes critical for lung function, including mucociliary clearance, surfactant secretion, and local blood flow. Cellular ATP release is mechanosensitive; however, the impact of physical stimuli on ATP release during breathing has never been tested in intact lungs in real time and remains elusive. In this pilot study, we investigated inflation-induced ATP release in rat lungs ex vivo by real-time luciferin-luciferase (LL) bioluminescence imaging coupled with simultaneous infrared tissue imaging to identify ATP-releasing sites. With LL solution introduced into air spaces, brief inflation of such edematous lung (1 s, ~20 cmH2O) induced transient (<30 s) ATP release in a limited number of air-inflated alveolar sacs during their recruitment/opening. Released ATP reached concentrations of ~10(-6) M, relevant for autocrine/paracrine signaling, but it remained spatially restricted to single alveolar sacs or their clusters. ATP release was stimulus dependent: prolonged (100 s) inflation evoked long-lasting ATP release that terminated upon alveoli deflation/derecruitment while cyclic inflation/suction produced cyclic ATP release. With LL introduced into blood vessels, inflation induced transient ATP release in many small patchlike areas the size of alveolar sacs. Findings suggest that inflation induces ATP release in both alveoli and the surrounding blood capillary network; the functional units of ATP release presumably consist of alveolar sacs or their clusters. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of real-time ATP release imaging in ex vivo lungs and provides the first direct evidence of inflation-induced ATP release in lung air spaces and in pulmonary blood capillaries, highlighting the importance of purinergic signaling in lung function.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.\n",

      "Extracellular ATP and other purines are ubiquitous mediators of local intercellular signaling within the body. While the last two decades have witnessed enormous progress in uncovering and characterizing purinergic receptors and extracellular enzymes controlling purinergic signals, our understanding of the initiating step in this cascade, i.e., ATP release, is still obscure. Imaging of extracellular ATP by luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence offers the advantage of studying ATP release and distribution dynamics in real time. However, low-light signal generated by bioluminescence reactions remains the major obstacle to imaging such rapid processes, imposing substantial constraints on its spatial and temporal resolution. We have developed an improved microscopy system for real-time ATP imaging, which detects ATP-dependent luciferin-luciferase luminescence at ~10 frames/s, sufficient to follow rapid ATP release with sensitivity of ~10 nM and dynamic range up to 100 muM. In addition, simultaneous differential interference contrast cell images are acquired with infra-red optics. Our imaging method: (1) identifies ATP-releasing cells or sites, (2) determines absolute ATP concentration and its spreading manner at release sites, and (3) permits analysis of ATP release kinetics from single cells. We provide instrumental details of our approach and give several examples of ATP-release imaging at cellular and tissue levels, to illustrate its potential utility.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
